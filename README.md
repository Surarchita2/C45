Project 45:

New Game (WH) Game Design and Planning:

1. What is the title of your application?
_

2. What is the storyline of your application?
You fall asleep ad go into a "dream" where your favorite pendent was stolen and you have to get it back by battling all the monsters there are.
 You have a few moves which you can use and evolve based on your points.
 You have to finish the level before your HP bar runs out and it will replenish every level.
 At the end you finish all the level and will get a souvenir from every boss you fought.
 When you wake up (after finishing all the 5 levels), you find not only you pendant neckalce at your nightstand, but also the 5 Souvenirs - proving the dream to actually be reality.

3. What is the goal of the application?
The goal of the application is that you have to pass through all the level to get back your necklace.

4. What is the motivation/inspiration behind the idea?
The motivation behind the idea is a book that I read.

5. What are the different characters of the application?
The different characters are: The main player, The “Bosses” ( different colors), The lost Necklace, The pathways, and the souvenirs. 

6. What is the behavior of each character? 
_

7. What are the elements of skill? (Based off player’s skill)
The elements of skill are the levels.

8. What are the elements of chance? (Based of the game’s intensity)
The elements of change are fair. The game starts out fairly simple and its intensity increases as you level up.

9. How does the application provide a balance between the elements of skill and chance?
The game provides a balance of elements and skills by starting out simple and increases its intensity as you level up. This also includes elements of skill as it doesn’t start out super hard.

10. How does the game provide feedback to the player?
The game provides feedback to the player by having levels, lives, and points. 

11. Is it a single or multiplayer game?
It is a Single Player game.

12. Draw a picture of your imagination based off the game design?
_

13. Gather all media files (ex: images, sounds, animation) - based on the game design?
